While this repository is public, we haven't made significant effort to make it accessible.

If it interests you, let us know! http://melt.cs.umn.edu/

To build, you need a copy of:

* ableC: https://github.com/melt-umn/ableC
* silver: https://github.com/melt-umn/silver

Silver needs to be installed, and `ableC` should be checked out next to `ableP`.

## Notes

This repo has been mildly modernized in its file organization (i.e. as it existed in our old svn), but mostly left as it was.

Test related files have been left under `edu.umn.cs.melt.ableP/artifacts/*/tests` for the time being.
