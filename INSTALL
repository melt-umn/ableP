To use ableP you need the newest version of Silver - 0.3.3.

This tar file to be expanded such that the "ableP" directory is
insides the directory structure matching the name of the grammars.
That is, it must be inside the directory structure
   edu/umn/cs/melt/

You also need the ableC concrete syntax grammar, which can be found at
http://melt.cs.umn.edu/ableP as well.  The ableC tar file expands into
a directory named ableC and should also be placed in the
edu/umn/cs/melt directory, next to the ableP directory.

More general instructions for installing and using Silver are
available on the Silver site at melt.cs.umn.edu/silver.

The 'silver-compile' scripts found in the artifacts/promela and
artifacts/aviaion directories may need to be modified to point to
where Silver has been installed.  These scripts set the GRAMMAR_PATH
environment variable to point to the directory containing the
enclosing "edu" directory.

Running the script will generate a tar file that can be executed with
the name of a sample file as the parameter.

For example, in artifacts/aviation after running "./silver-compile"
one can run "java -jar aviation.ableP.jar Samples/AltSwitch.xpml" to
genrerate the pure Promela language version of this model.  It will be
called Samples/AltSwitch_HOST.pml.
