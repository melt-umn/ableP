** ableP - Attribute grammar Based Language Extensions for Promela **

ableP is an extensible specification of Promela, the modeling language
used by the SPIN model checker.

IMPORTANT NOTE: ableP is a research project and while we do endeavor
to create useful working software there are quite possibly bugs and
missing functionality.  Consult with us if you will to use ableP for
"serious" work.  We make no guarantees about the features or
performance of ableP.
